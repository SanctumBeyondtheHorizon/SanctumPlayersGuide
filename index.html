 </div><span class="inline-block "  style="margin-top:1px;"></span><p>Sanctum Beyond the Horizon is a science-fantasy Pathfinder Second Edition Living World Campaign. A living world campaign is one where the characters persist in a shared environment across multiple sessions with a variety of GMs as well as text roleplay hosted in our Discord server. Sanctum Beyond the Horizon is explicitly a welcoming space for players of marginalized demographics. Bigotry of any kind will not be tolerated. We hope you enjoy your adventures with us!</p>

<span class="inline-block "  style="margin-top:20px;"></span><h2 id="community-guidelines">Community Guidelines</h2>
<span class="inline-block margin-top"  ></span><ol>
<li><strong>Respect Each Other</strong>
Sanctum is a place where people of all nationalities, religions, genders and orientations come together to enjoy Pathfinder Second Edition. Bigotry and disrespect are not tolerated. Out of Character Conflicts will be handled through a ticket with staff or off of server.</li>
</ol>
<span class="inline-block margin-top"  ></span><ol start="2">
<li><strong>Age and Mature content</strong>
This is strictly an 18+ campaign. Similarly, all characters must be clearly depicted as adults for their age. This is a zero tolerance policy. Sexual content is limited under our Prohibited Topics. Generalized jokes and references, as well as brief mentions of the relations of the characters are acceptable. Anything else falls under our Prohibited Topics.</li>
</ol>
<span class="inline-block margin-top"  ></span><ol start="3">
<li><strong>Prohibited Topics</strong>
The following topics are not permitted on the server.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Sexual Violence</li>
<li>Real World Politics</li>
<li>Excessive Descriptions of Obscenity</li>
</ul>
<span class="inline-block margin-top"  ></span><ol start="4">
<li><strong>Managing Player Conflicts</strong>
Out of Character conflicts are inevitable. But they must be handled respectfully. In the event of an OOC Conflict, attempt to resolve it in DMs if you feel safe to. Otherwise #create-a-ticket and staff will attempt to assist with a resolution. Not all player conflicts will warrant a response, but for those that do, we will do our best to ensure an agreeable solution for all parties.</li>
</ol>
<span class="inline-block margin-top"  ></span><ol start="5">
<li><strong>Duplicate Accounts</strong>
You may only use one account and one set of characters per player.</li>
</ol>
<span class="inline-block margin-top"  ></span><ol start="6">
<li><strong>Extenuating Circumstances</strong>
There will be events that may not fall under any of the existing rules. In all circumstances, follow staff guidance. In urgent scenarios such as obvious spam, blatant abuse, and only then, pinging @Moderator and @Admin is acceptable. Otherwise, #create-a-ticket and await a response.</li>
</ol>
<span class="inline-block margin-top"  ></span><h2 id="roleplay-guidelines">Roleplay Guidelines</h2>
<div class='columnSplit'>  </div><span class="inline-block "  style="margin-top:20px;;"></span><ol>
<li><strong>Don’t Be Obscene</strong>
There are to be no in depth descriptions of sexual and mature content. Additionally, depictions of violence should be kept to a cinematic level. Excessive depictions of violence are not allowed.</li>
</ol>
<span class="inline-block margin-top"  ></span><ol start="2">
<li><strong>Reflavoring Character Options</strong>
Due to the nature of a living world server, Sanctum has restrictions for how far a character option can be reflavored. A spade is a spade and must be used as such, however, a war ax or hammer can have embellishments that make it reminiscent of a shovel. Similarly, spell manifestations always incorporate sigils that clearly indicate the spell being used for purposes of Identify a Spell. Otherwise, the exact appearance is flexible. If a particular instance of relfavoring is questionable, #create-a-ticket.</li>
</ol>
<span class="inline-block margin-top"  ></span><ol start="3">
<li><strong>Using the Roleplay Channels</strong>
The #sanctum-sessions forum channel is for roleplay scenes between two or more characters. These are scenes that take place in specific locations and times not represented by the open roleplay channels. They will be listed as Open, Closed, or Ask.</li>
</ol>
<span class="inline-block margin-top"  ></span><p>Open RP forums can be joined by anyone at any time. Closed RP forums can only be joined by those on the whitelist at the top post. Do not ask to join these forums. Forum posts labeled Ask have a whitelist of allowed players. If you wish to join an Ask RP thread, ping the active roleplayers in #ask-to-rp. You can also use that channel to post small blurbs or topics to pique interest to generate a scene.</p>
<span class="inline-block margin-top"  ></span><p>The remaining channels are open roleplay channels that follow the flow of real world time. These channels are open for anyone to join at any time and progress according to server time. Sanctum follows a day night cycle that aligns with the time zone of Eastern US, EST and EDT. This is Server Time. </p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Share the Spotlight</strong>
Whether in game or text roleplay, passing the spotlight is an important tool. Monologues and drabbles are great ways to flesh out your character, and should be posted in #sanctum-roleplay with the Drabble tag. In scenes with multiple characters, each message or action should end by passing the spotlight back to another player. This creates an  active flow that will lead the scene to a satisfying conclusion.</li>

			<div class="columnWrapper"><ol start="5">
<li><strong>Text Roleplay Etiquette</strong>
Text roleplay needs to be written in a semi literate fashion and legible. Semi literate writing is in full sentences with mostly proper punctuation. Grammar and spelling errors are allowed, nobody is perfect. Nonstandard fonts are an accessibility issue and are never allowed. Emotes, emoticons, and links are always considered Out of Character. Dice rolls must be kept to #dice-rolls-rp</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Actions should be formatted in italics.</li>
<li>Thoughts should be ‘italicized and placed in single quotes.’</li>
<li>Speech should be “placed in quotation marks”</li>
<li>Out of character talk should be kept to a minimum and kept between || Spoiler Bars||</li>
</ul>
<ol start="6">
<li><strong>In Character Conflict</strong>
Many times the best roleplay puts characters at odds with each other. Sometimes however, players may not have the same goals for a particular instance of character conflict, especially in ones where dice are rolled and damage is dealt. Players looking to create in character conflicts are required to use a thread in #conflict-consent to discuss the scope of the conflict with their roleplay partner. In cases where a scene devolves into conflict unexpectedly, players are required to pause and check in with their roleplay partner in a thread in #conflict-consent.</li>
